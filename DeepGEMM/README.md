# DeepGEMM

DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs). It supports FP8 and BF16 (working in progress) for both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped scenarios. Written in CUDA, the library has no kernel compilation need during installation, by compiling all kernels at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.

DeepGEMM leverages some concepts from [CUTLASS](https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass) and [CuTe](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute), it avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. Instead, the library is designed for simplicity, with only a limited number of core kernel functions. This makes it a clean and accessible resource for learning NVIDIA GPU kernel optimization techniques.

Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.

## Interfaces

#### Notices

This library provides optimized GEMM kernels for NVIDIA GPUs with a naming convention: `D = C + A @ B`. The input shape layout is NT (non-transposed A, transposed B). While the SM90 implementation supports only the NT memory layout (row-major, col-major), the SM100 implementation supports all memory layouts (NT, TN, NN, TT). For example, `fp8_gemm_nt` will do a `D = C + A @ B.T`

For both architectures, the LHS scaling factor is required to have a TMA-aligned and transposed layout. And the data format for the scaling factor of SM90 and SM100 is different:

- SM90 requires scaling factors in FP32 format.
- SM100 requires scaling factors in packed [UE8M0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alternate-floating-point-data-formats) format, which packs 4 UE8M0 into a single `torch.int`.

Please note that operations like input transposition or FP8 casting must be handled separately by the user, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.

#### Normal dense GEMMs (non-grouped)

To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the `fp8_gemm_{nt, nn, tn, tt}` function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.

#### Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)

Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape. For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (`get_mk_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()`).  For more information, please refer to the `m_grouped_fp8_gemm_{nt, nn}_contiguous` function documentation.

We also provide a K-axis-grouped API for MoE weight backward (with M and N must remain fixed), please refer to `k_grouped_fp8_gemm_tn_contiguous` for more information.

#### Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)

During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.

Use `m_grouped_fp8_gemm_nt_masked` for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from [DeepEP](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP) as input.

#### V3.2 MQA kernels for the indexer

The kernel family has two versions, non-paged (for prefilling) and paged (for decoding).
Take the non-paged version `fp8_mqa_logits` as an example. It has 6 inputs:

- `q`, E4M3 tensor with shape `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`
- `kv`, E4M3 tensor (shaped as `[seq_len_kv, head_dim]`) with float SF (shaped as `[seq_len_kv]`)
- `weights`, float tensor with shape `[seq_len, num_heads]`
- `cu_seq_len_k_start` and `cu_seq_len_k_end`, int tensor with shape `[seq_len]`
- `clean_logits`, whether to clean the unfilled logits into `-inf`

The output tensor is shaped as `[seq_len, seq_len_kv]`, indicating token-to-token logits.
For each token `i` in `q`, it will iterate all tokens `j` from `[cu_seq_len_k_start[i], cu_seq_len_k_end[i])`,
and calculate the logit `out[i, j]` as:

```python
kv_j = kv[0][j, :] * kv[1][j].unsqueeze(1)  # [head_dim]
out_ij = q[i, :, :] @ kv_j  # [num_heads]
out_ij = out_ij.relu() * weights[i, :]  # [num_heads]
out_ij = out_ij.sum()  # Scalar
```

For more details and the paged version `fp8_paged_mqa_logits`, please refer to `tests/test_attention.py`.

#### Utilities

The library provides some utility functions besides the above kernels:

- `deep_gemm.set_num_sms`: set the maximum SM count to use
- `deep_gemm.get_num_sms`: get the current SM maximum count (return the device SM count if not set)
- `deep_gemm.set_tc_util`: set an approximated tensor core utilization ratio
- `deep_gemm.get_tc_util`: get the current tensor core utilization ratio
- `deep_gemm.transform_sf_into_required_layout`: transform scaling factors into required layout
- `deep_gemm.get_tma_aligned_size`: get the required TMA alignment size

- `deep_gemm.get_mn_major_tma_aligned_tensor`: get a MN-major TMA-aligned tensor
- `deep_gemm.get_mn_major_tma_aligned_packed_ue8m0_tensor`: get a MN-major TMA-aligned tensor (with packing FP32 into UE8M0)
- `deep_gemm.get_k_grouped_mn_major_tma_aligned_packed_ue8m0_tensor`: K-grouped GEMM packing kernel

- General
  - `DG_JIT_DEBUG`: `0` or `1`, print more JIT debugging information, `0` by default

  - `DG_JIT_NVCC_COMPILER`: string, specified NVCC compiler path; will find in `torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME` by default
- Compiler options
  - `DG_JIT_PTXAS_VERBOSE`: `0` or `1`, show detailed PTXAS compiler output, `0` by default
  - `DG_JIT_PRINT_COMPILER_COMMAND`: `0` or `1`, print NVCC compilation command, `0` by default
